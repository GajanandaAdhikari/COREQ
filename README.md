## Abstract

This proposal outlines the creation of COREQ (Community for Reprising Qualitative Research), a platform aimed at inspiring college students to share their knowledge, innovative ideas, and project files within their college domain. The platform will serve as a hub for students to find peers, form project teams, participate in competitions, and foster collaboration. It aims to address the lack of a digitalized platform for sharing and discussing innovative ideas, providing query assistance, and facilitating communication among students, seniors, peers, and teachers outside of regular coursework. The objective is to enhance job placement prospects and showcase projects. This proposal outlines specific objectives, such as building a user-friendly website, allowing registration and sharing of research articles and original ideas, facilitating open-source projects, and involving teachers as supervisors and resource providers.
